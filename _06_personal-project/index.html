      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in the Hudson Valley of New York. I grew up tinkering with computers, hardware mostly, but never thought I'd find myself as interested in software engineering as I am now.
      </p>
<p>Fascinated with nature and its inhabitants, I chose to study philosophy in college and later began an early career in clinical psychology. As much as I enjoyed helping others solve their problems, I quickly realized that I'd rather help solve others problems by doing something creative, such as creating software and applications that can make life a little better for everyone, so now I'm here!</p>
<p>I'm an avid mountain biker, so if I'm not behind my computer I'm probably on the trails with my bike. Mountain biking is partially why I chose to move to Colorado, and I've met some of the most important people in my life from it here.</p>
